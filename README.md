#ADC test code
to develop ADC functionality for power meter application

#Hardware
This project is designed to run on a Nucleo 64 board. The board is marked **NUCLEO-F446RE** and is based on the STM32F446 MCU.

A custom PCB will be connected to the Nucleo development board. The PCB will house an interface to 3 Current Transformers and 1 Voltage transformer for the purpose bringing AC Voltage and up to 3 current signals to the Analog inputs of the MCU.
